bisect-example
==============

An example repository with an obvious fault way back in its history.

The scripts that create the "nonsense" commits are from my friend Matthew: [git@github.com:gitworkbook/bisect-example.git](git@github.com:gitworkbook/bisect-example.git)

_This repository is used by the Git Workbook, which is available from LeanPub http://leanpub.com/gitworkbook_
